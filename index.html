    <h3>Projects and Workshops</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master Thesis project on comparing different classifiers using heart disease
        prediction model gives an overview of machine learning addressing issues such as
        over-fitting and under-fitting, handling missing values and highlights performance
        comparison methods. The research includes complete understanding of six
        classification techniques and structure of the algorithms. The purpose of this research is to understand the overall concept of machine learning. On considering a dataset with patients records we will construct a complete machine learning
        model that predicts whether or not they have heart disease. This paper will discuss the key issues such as model overfitting, underfitting and techniques to handle missing values.</li>
      <li>Estimating the credit risk of customer in bank sector - A Data Science project by
        adopting predictive analysis techniques in credit application. Data Science is a concept of running experiments on data in order to analyse and find actionable insights within it. Data Science framework involves Data Analysis, Data
        Visualisation, Machine Learning, Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Web Scrapping, Mathematics, and Programming Skills.</li>
      <li>Time series forecasting of Solar Radiation – Data Driven Decision Making, applying
        regression methods such as Linear regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,
        Decision Tree and Bayesian Ridge Regression. Solar energy is a renewable resource that can be converted into electricity by concentrated photovoltaics which uses sunlight as the source. To establish solar power plant, factors such as
        Humidity, Radiation, Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed, Sun rise time and Sun set time plays an important role. A prototype is developed to predict Solar Power Radiation considering feature analysis and solutions made on regression techniques
        using machine learning.</li>
      <li>Project on Data Visualisation - Forbes Top 2000 companies using Tableau Desktop
        Pro and Prep Builder. The main objective is to create an easy visualization that could be describe structures and dimension of dataset.</li>
